luFactor Function Readme
Description
luFactor is a MATLAB function that performs LU decomposition with partial pivoting on a square coefficient matrix, returning the lower triangular matrix L, upper triangular matrix U, and the permutation matrix P.

Syntax
[L, U, P] = luFactor(A)

Inputs
A - the coefficient matrix
Outputs
L - the lower triangular matrix
U - the upper triangular matrix
P - the permutation matrix

Example
A = [4 3 2; 2 2 3; 3 1 -2];
[L, U, P] = luFactor(A)
This example will return L, U and P matrices of the coefficient matrix A, which have been calculated using LU decomposition with partial pivoting.

Notes
The coefficient matrix A must be square, otherwise an error will be thrown.
Partial pivoting is used in the algorithm to avoid division by zero and improve numerical stability.
