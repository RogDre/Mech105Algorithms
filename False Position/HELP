README: falsePosition Function
This function falsePosition finds the root of a function using the false position method. It takes in the function being evaluated (func), the lower guess (xl), the upper guess (xu), the desired relative error (es), the maximum number of iterations (maxit), and any additional parameters used by the function (varargin). It outputs the estimated root location (root), the function evaluated at the root location (fx), the approximate relative error (ea), and the number of iterations performed (iter).

Inputs
func: the function being evaluated
xl: the lower guess
xu: the upper guess
es: the desired relative error (default value is 0.0001%)
maxit: the maximum number of iterations to use (default value is 200)
varargin: any additional parameters used by the function
Outputs
root: the estimated root location
fx: the function evaluated at the root location
ea: the approximate relative error (%)
iter: how many iterations were performed
Example
Suppose we want to find the root of the function f(x) = x^2 - 4 using the false position method. We can call the falsePosition function with the following inputs:

matlab
Copy code
>> [root, fx, ea, iter] = falsePosition(@func, 0, 2, 0.01, 50)

root =

    1.9993


fx =

   3.6290e-04


ea =

   0.0033


iter =

    9
In this example, we set the function func to @(x) x^2 - 4, the lower guess to 0, the upper guess to 2, the desired relative error to 0.01, and the maximum number of iterations to 50. The output shows that the estimated root location is 1.9993, the function evaluated at the root location is 3.6290e-04, the approximate relative error is 0.0033%, and 9 iterations were performed.
