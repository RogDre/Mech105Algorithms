Each algorithm comes with its own readme file that provides detailed instructions on how to use it. Make sure to read the readme file carefully before using any of the algorithms.

## Algorithms

This repository contains the following MATLAB algorithms:

- **Bisection Method:** This algorithm uses the bisection method to find the root of a function within a given interval.

- **False Position Method:** This algorithm uses the false position method to find the root of a function within a given interval.

- **LU Factorization:** This algorithm performs LU factorization on a given matrix.

- **Simpson's 1/3 Rule:** This algorithm uses Simpson's 1/3 rule to numerically integrate a function.


Each algorithm is contained in its own folder, which contains the MATLAB script and a readme file with detailed instructions on how to use the algorithm.
