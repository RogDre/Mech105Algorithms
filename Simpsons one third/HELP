# Simpson's 1/3 Rule

This MATLAB function `Simpson(x,y)` calculates the definite integral of a set of equidistant data points using Simpson's 1/3 rule. It takes two input vectors `x` and `y`, which represent the independent and dependent variables, and returns the definite integral `I` of the data.

## Inputs

`x` : Vector of independent variable data points
`y` : Vector of dependent variable data points

## Outputs

`I` : The definite integral of the input data using Simpson's 1/3 rule.

## Example

Suppose we want to find the integral of `y = x^2` from `x = 0` to `x = 1`, using 10 equally spaced data points. We can define the `x` and `y` vectors and then call the `Simpson` function as follows:

```MATLAB
x = linspace(0,1,10);
y = x.^2;
I = Simpson(x,y)
```

The output will be the value of the integral using Simpson's 1/3 rule.
